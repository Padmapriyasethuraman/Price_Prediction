# Google Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

 Overview

This project demonstrates how to predict Google's stock price using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suitable for time series prediction. The implementation includes data preprocessing, LSTM model training, and evaluation.

 Dependencies
